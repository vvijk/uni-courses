This repository serves as a centralized hub for organizing and showcasing my university coursework.

## Courses

Here is a list of courses included in this repository:

1. **ProgramsprÃ¥k (DVGC01) [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/vvijk/uni-courses/tree/main/DVGC01-programsprak)**
   - Description: This course provides an overview of different programming languages with a focus on programming paradigms: imperative, functional, and declarative. Additionally, object-oriented languages are covered. The course delves into concepts such as syntax, semantics, grammar, lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and symbol tables. Implementation aspects, including execution system implementation, memory management, stack management, and activation records, are explored. The structural aspects of programming languages are also discussed.
   - Labs: During this course, I took the theoretical concepts we learned and put them into practice through some cool projects! One of them involved creating a Lisp program and a Prolog program specifically designed to parse Pascal code. It was a bit challenging, but super rewarding.

2. **Datakommunikation 1 (DVGB02) [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/vvijk/uni-courses/tree/main/DVGB02)**
   - The course covers, among other things:
      * The structure of the Internet, its various components, and services.
      * The functions of different network applications (web and HTTP, FTP, email, DNS).
      *  Socket programming.
      * Functionality and protocols in different layers of the TCP/IP stack.
      * Wired and wireless local networks.

3. **Javascript fÃ¶r webbutveckling (ISGB15)**
   - Description:The course explores the effective use of JavaScript for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. Key topics include:
      * JavaScript Fundamentals:
           - Application of methods and properties in classes and objects.
           - Creation of custom functions for enhanced interactivity.
      * Event Handling:
           - Implementation of event-driven scenarios for function triggering.
      * HTML Form Validation:
           - Utilization of JavaScript for validating HTML forms.
      * DOM Manipulation:
           - Understanding the role of the Document Object Model (DOM).
           - Dynamic alteration of HTML and CSS using DOM.
             
This course was a hands-on journey, mixing lectures with practical development. The real gem was crafting a Tic-Tac-Toe game through four engaging labs, bringing the theoretical concepts togheter in a fun and interactive way.

> [!NOTE]
> Skeleton code was provided to us as a starting point in some of the assignments, but the main logic and implementations were developed either entirely by me or in collaboration with my lab group.
