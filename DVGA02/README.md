# BREAKOUT GAME

In this course, we explored both programming using an object-oriented programming language and techniques within software development that encourage *abstraction*, *modularization*, and *reusability*.

As part of a practical laboration, we had to create a simple breakout game that not only provides an interactive gaming experience but also incorporates features for tracking latest runs and high score.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
