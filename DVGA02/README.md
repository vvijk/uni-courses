# BREAKOUT GAME

In this course, we explored both programming using an object-oriented programming language and techniques within software development that encourage abstraction, modularization, and reusability.

We got to make a simple breakout game that also can handle latest runs and highscore

As part of a practical laboration, we had to create a simple breakout game that not only provides an interactive gaming experience but also incorporates features for tracking latest runs and high score.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
